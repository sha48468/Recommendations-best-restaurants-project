A project to analyze data and create a smart intelligent system based on SQL and Python (Jupyter Notebook).

Project description:
 The project includes an intelligent recommendation system based on data stored in SQL Server.
 Users enter data into the order table, and processing is performed to recommend additional products to them.
 In Jupyter Notebook, the data is loaded from the DB, information is processed and visualizations are created to present the insights.

 Technologies and tools in the project:
 SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – for saving the data and executing queries.
 Python (pandas, pyodbc, seaborn, matplotlib) - for connecting to the DB, processing the data and displaying graphs.
 Jupyter Notebook - for data development and analysis.
 GitHub – for managing the code and sharing the project.

 the work process:
 Creating a database and tables in SQL Server.
 Writing advanced SQL queries - including JOIN, GROUP BY, triggers and recommendation processes.
 Connecting Python to SQL using pyodbc.
 Performing data analysis with Pandas and creating graphs with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
 Visual presentation of the results - graphs and reports.

 How to run the project on your computer?
 Must be installed:

 SQL Server + SSMS
 Python + Jupyter Notebook
 The libraries pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, pyodbc

 Products - what do you see in the results?
 The table of recommendations - a list of recommended products for customers.
 Graphs and visualizations - the graph of the most recommended products.
 Advanced SQL reports - system performance.

 Ideas for future improvement:
 -Strengthening the model with Machine Learning for smarter recommendations
 -Building a web interface for presenting the recommendations (Flask/Django)
 -Connecting the data to Power BI or Google Data Studio
